Challenge: find-the-plastic-flow

- Approaches: Plotting each data point with magnitude and direction over the course of a month.
- Technologies: CARTO.js, CartoCSS
- We were able to accurately show the data relatively but the transition over time is not as visually smooth as we would like it.
- In the future, we could overlay data that tracks the movement of a single object to potentially predict the future position and/or past position of a given object at any location.
